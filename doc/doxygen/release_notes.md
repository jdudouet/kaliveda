## Version 1.11/01 (current development focus)

\ref GlobalVariables

Major rewrite of global variable classes.

Previously, there was much source of confusion as
different variables could have specific ways of defining which nuclei they would include,
in which frame, etc., while the base methods of KVVarGlob for defining particle selection
and kinematical frames were not always respected by all classes.

Now, the same logic is applied to all global variable classes:

  * individual variable classes define *only* how they are filled from nuclei
    by overriding KVVarGlob::fill(),
    KVVarGlob::fill2() or KVVarGlob::fillN() method, depending on whether they are 1-, 2- or
    \f$N\f$-body observables, respectively;
    
  * particle selection is handled *only* by use of
    KVVarGlob::SetSelection() and (new) KVVarGlob::AddSelection() methods; the latter
    adds a selection which will operate in addition to any existing selection (logical AND); 

  * kinematic frame selection is handled *only* by use of KVVarGlob::SetFrame(); note that
  the same frame will also be used for any kinematic quantities used to select particles.
  
As an example, consider the KVEtrans variable, which calculates the sum of transverse kinetic
energies for each event. Without writing a new class, the same variable can be used
in very different ways:

~~~~~~{.cpp}
KVEtrans e1("et"); // total transverse energy of all particles

KVEtrans e2("et_imf");
e2.SetSelection("_NUC_->GetZ()>2"); // total transverse energy of fragments

KVEtrans e3("et_imf_fwcm");
e3.SetSelection("_NUC_->GetZ()>2");
e3.AddSelection("_NUC_->GetVpar()>0");
e3.SetFrame("CM"); // total transverse energy of fragments in forward CM hemisphere
~~~~~~

In addition, as part of this rationalization, all existing global variables calculating
multiplicities, or sums or mean values of scalar quantities have been reimplemented
using KVVGSum, which vastly reduces code replication.
