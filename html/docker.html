<dt>KaliVeda Docker containers</dt>
As part of our Continuous Integration efforts, <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">Docker containers</a>
of the KaliVeda toolkit are automatically generated for several versions of ROOT and using several
different OS every time that a new change is committed to the
<a href="https://github.com/kaliveda-dev/kaliveda">git repository</a>. This is to ensure that new
changes to code do not lead to compilation errors with older ROOT versions or compilers. 
</dl>

<dl>
In order to use one, for example the 1.10 branch compiled with ROOT version 5.34, try

<div class="code">$ docker run -it gitlab-registry.in2p3.fr/kaliveda/docker/root5.34/kaliveda:1.10</div>

The list of all available
containers can be found <a href="https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/kaliveda/docker/container_registry">here</a>.
Details on the generation of the containers can be found <a href="https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/kaliveda/docker">here</a>.

<dl>
<dt>ROOT Docker containers</dt>
As a side effect of our CI, we also maintain several non-official ROOT docker containers
(official containers can be found <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/rootproject">here</a>) which
are updated automatically on a weekly basis with the latest versions of the code.

In order to use one, for example the latest ROOT version (tip of master branch), try

<div class="code">$ docker run -it gitlab-registry.in2p3.fr/kaliveda/root-docker:latest</div>

The list of all available
containers can be found <a href="https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/kaliveda/root-docker/container_registry">here</a>.
